# MLOps-GCP-Cloud-Build-Deployment-Pipeline-automation (Manual Trigger)

This Repository contains notebook,scripts and files for building MLOps-GCP-Cloud-Build-Deployment-Pipeline-automation.

## Deep Learning Project ðŸ’»

The project is based on a simple image cllasification on Leaf Disease Problem, it contains 3 classes of leaf disease, `['angular_leaf_spot', 'bean_rust', 'healthy']`.Our task is to predict the class of the image.

I have already build the whole Deep Learning Project and Saved its artifacts in models folder.So now we can easily build a pipeline to deploy our model in GCP and automate it.


## Deployment ðŸš€
The whole MLops workflow in GCP looks like this:

In the above Pipeline I am using K8s as the orchestrator and whole pipeline is automated with GCP Cloud Build.

### Services Used:

1. Google Cloud Build
2. Google Kubernetes Engine
3. Google Container Registry

cloudbuild.yaml
```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/imgwebapp:v1', '.']
  timeout: 180s
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/imgwebapp:v1']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  entrypoint: "bash"
  args:
  - "-c"
  - |
    echo "Docker Container Built"
    ls -la
    ls -al models/
- name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gke-deploy"
  args:
  - run
  - --filename=k8s/
  - --location=us-west1-b
  - --cluster=project-kube
  - --timeout=500s
```

You can see in the above yaml the project is first pushed to gcr as a image and from gcr, gke takes the image and deploys it as a service.

This pipleine can be customized for any project.

## Usage ðŸ“¦  

You need to run the following command to initilize the K8s cluster and then kick start the pipeline:

**Create a K8s Cluster:**

```bash
gcloud container clusters create project-kube --zone "us-west1-b" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --num-nodes "1"
```

</p>


**KickStart Pipeline:**

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```
**Build Summary:**

## Code ðŸ†˜

The code is present in the form of a notebook and a streamlit app.But one needs to have a billing-enabled GCP account with a few APIs enabled (GKE,GCR) to successfully run these notebooks and scripts.
